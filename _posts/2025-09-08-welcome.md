Welcome to my academic website!  

I’m **Yihong (程奕泓) Cheng**, an **Assistant Professor** at the *School of Education, City University of Macau*. My work centers on **STEM education**, **curriculum and assessment design**, and **educational measurement**.  

Through my research, I design and evaluate STEM programs while developing and validating instruments that capture key competencies for today’s learners — from **computational thinking** and **AI literacy** to **global competitiveness** and **career readiness**.  

This site is where I share updates on my publications, projects, and collaborations. I invite you to explore and connect if you are interested in advancing innovative and equitable approaches to STEM learning.
