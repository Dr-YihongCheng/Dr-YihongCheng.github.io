Hi, and welcome to my academic website!  

I’m **Yihong (程奕泓) Cheng**, a Postdoctoral Fellow (Shuimu Scholar) at the *Institute of Education, Tsinghua University*. My work explores **STEM education, curriculum and assessment design, and educational measurement**.  

I created this site to share updates on my research, teaching, and collaborations — from developing **AI literacy instruments** to co-designing **project-based learning experiences** in schools.  

Feel free to look around, explore my recent projects and publications, and get in touch if you’d like to connect!
